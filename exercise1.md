Let's say we are working with Java. As for the first bullet point: Fir linting Java there seems to be multiple solutions. Checkstyle and sonalint to mention a couple. There seems to exiat even more testing tools, like JSUnit, Jasmine and Karma. For the build tools, there are options like Ant and Maven.

Even though Jenkins and GItHub Actions are among the most popular CI setups, thre are also alternatives for Java setups. CircleCI and TravisCi to mention a couple again. It's hard to say what the differences are at this point of the course chapter, but it seems clear that threre are many options which most probably are different somehow. Otehrwise they would not have any competetive edge as a product or a service.

If we have 6 people working on the product, then I would say that the porject is rather small. In this case a cloud-based setup would probably be better. This way the CI setup would hopefully be easier and the six people could focus more on the code itself. On the other hand, even small projects might have some characteristics that would speak for a self-hosted environment. These are some kind of exotic things that the could-based setups are not just made for. In the end, the team itself would know what they need for their given use case and requirements.
